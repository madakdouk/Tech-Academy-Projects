### Divas Archive
This is a basic HTML and CSS website that I made, showcasing a stylized nav bar, animated image containers, and a contact form. I made it my own by focusing the content on my favorite pop divas :)

### Movie theater site
This movie theater website was stylized using Bootstrap 4. It is simple, but uses many different Bootstrap components.

### Portfolio website
My portfolio website is hosted through GitHub Pages! It showcases a fixed navbar, a 2-column layout, animated pictures and text, and a video backdrop with text overlay.
